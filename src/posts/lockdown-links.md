You bored yet?

I'm on day 10 of a 14-day COVID quarantine with my partner, in our one bedroom flat. Now, I can't complain. I have an introverted nature, a long to-do list of self-directed creative projects, and a profession which is well suited to working remotely. But even I must be a _tiny_ bit bored, because I'm writing this blog post.

I thought I'd share a small selection of links with you, because I believe that if you click on any of these links, you will no longer be bored. I've gone for straight-up entertainment rather than recommend you a load of constructive, self-improvement type shit to do. And I've restricted it to stuff you can watch/read immediately rather than needing an account or subscription or to order something or to go somewhere. Don't be going somewhere! Do your civic duty and stay home (and click on these:)

Limmy's a good example.
-   <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-last-true-hermit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">The Last True Hermit</a> - I liked this article enough to keep it in my browser bookmarks for years, and it's rather apt for this time of social distancing.
-   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">The Paradox of Choice</a> - my favourite TED talk because it helped me to accept and enjoy my life, from the tiny things to the big things, rather than feel like I failed at everything, from the tiny things to the big things.
-   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BNg4fDJC8A&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">How This Guy Folds and Flies World Record Paper Airplanes</a> - fascinating bit of homespun engineering. I think I could get into doing this stuff while stuck at home.
-   <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/01/will-influential-ui-design-minority-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Why Her Will Dominate UI Design</a> - an article about user interface design, primarily, which sounds boring if you don't work in tech, but trust me on this. Though you probably need to have watched the brilliant movie Her.
-   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17VKpoLJUbA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Barry Jenkins: The Intimate Close-Ups</a> - some eye candy - just the close-up shots from Barry Jenkins' last two masterful films.
-   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe6ACKMyF7I&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Dawin ft Silento - Dessert - TriciaMiranda Choreography</a> - I love dance, especially contemporary and street dance. Here's a good example of my fav type of street dance video. One where you see an extremely diverse group of dancers all murdering the same short choreo combo one after the other. I find it compelling to compare-and-contrast the various interpretations of the same few moves. And what's funny is how an obnoxious song becomes weirdly better with repetition, not worse, as the dancers hit all kinds of accents in the track which bring out rhythmic nuances and seem to add depth to it.
-   <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">The Fermi Paradox</a> - one of my favourite posts on Wait but Why, my favourite blog. He goes deep, deep into fascinating sciencey stuff, and does it in such a funny, digestible way.
-   <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-accidental-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">The Accidental Room</a> - visual artists usually learn to see 'negative space' in their early training. This awesome podcast episode tells the story of some artists that made a home from negative space, literally. It feels like something from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk or Douglas Coupland, and it's glorious.

The difference being - how is this guy not played by Paddy Considine?! How is this not a Shane Meadows mockumentary?
-   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8NAlDOCG6g&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Happiness comes from the simple things</a> - you will have seen this before, but take 15 seconds to watch it again because it never gets old, it will always make you grin ear to ear.
-   <a href="https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</a> - a thought provoking article which I believe spawned a book a year or two ago. One of the things that fascinates me about this Coronavirus crisis is how it might affect the world's attitude towards capitalism, by shining a spotlight on the work that we do. Most of us will be performing our jobs at a much reduced capacity for many months, and some estimate that around 25 million jobs will be lost entirely to it. After that happens, how many of us will suddenly reach the startling conclusion that what we did was never as important as we thought. That our own job need not - perhaps should not - exist at all? Now there's a can of worms.

I like how music so easily breaks down everyday social barriers and allows strangers to connect and have spontaneous fun.
