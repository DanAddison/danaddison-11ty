    <p>I'm a web engineer at London digital agency
      <a href="https://shape.works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Shape Works.</a>
    </p>

    <p>I specialise in WordPress, the world-leading Content Management System. WordPress is flexible, user-friendly, SEO-friendly, open-source and constantly evolving.</p>
    <p>At Shape Works we approach our Enterprise CMS WordPress builds with modern development tools and patterns, using Bedrock for enhanced security and dependency management, React for custom Gutenberg block development (I write occasional articles on this subject - 
      <a href="https://purrgroup.com/insights/blog/thinking-in-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">here's one</a>), and atomic deployments for robust zero downtime delivery (I wrote about this too, 
      <a href="https://purrgroup.com/blog/atomic-deployments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">here</a>).</p>

    <p>In my smaller scale personal and freelance projects, for keeping costs and maintenance demands close to zero, I like the JAMstack. In a nutshell:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.</p>
      <cite>jamstack.org</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This site is built on Eleventy - my other favourite static site generators are Gridsome and Gatsby which use the Vue and React JavaScript frameworks respectively. I enjoy experimenting with CSS-in-JS, utilising tools like Styled Components to create reusable, scalable UI component libraries.</p>
