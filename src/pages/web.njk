    <p>I'm a web engineer at London digital agency
      <a href="https://shape.works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">Shape Works.</a>
    </p>

    <p>At Shape Works we approach our enterprise WordPress builds with modern development tools and patterns, using Bedrock for enhanced security and dependency management, React.js for custom Gutenberg block development (I write occasional articles on this subject - 
      <a href="https://shape.works/article/thinking-in-blocks-wordpress-and-modular-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This is an external link (opens in a new tab)">here's one</a>), and atomic deployments for robust zero downtime delivery (I wrote about this too,

    <p>In my smaller scale personal and freelance projects, for keeping costs and maintenance demands close to zero, I prefer the JAMstack.</p>
    <p>This site is built on Eleventy - my other favourite static site generators are Gridsome and Gatsby which use the Vue and React JavaScript frameworks respectively. I enjoy experimenting with CSS-in-JS, utilising tools like Styled Components to create reusable, scalable UI component libraries.</p>
