    <h2>Culture</h2>

    <p>I have made a few videos to capture or comment upon creative life in Folkestone. One example is my Folkestone Triennial 2017 full walking tour, a breakneck explanation of all the artworks which also serves to orientate visitors to the town's geographical layout. Another favourite is my atmospheric record of the 2018 Cheriton Light Festival.</p>

    <h2>Travel Vlogs</h2>

    <p>Sometimes I like to turn my holidays into something of a creative project. I have found that these seemingly off-the-cuff videos are deceptively difficult to make, and can detract from the lived experience in the moment. But it always seems worthwhile in retrospect, as the videos become evocative time capsules of shared joy.</p>
