    <p>I have been writing, recording and performing original music since 2001.</p>
    
    <p>First I played introspective folks songs crafted around fingerstyle acoustic guitar in open tunings. While at art school in Kingston I joined a community of musicians staging experimental gigs combining classical, folk and post-rock styles. I played Glastonbury Festival in 2008.</p>

    <p>Then I focused on music production after moving back to Folkestone, recording many solo EPs and albums at home. I arranged pain-stakingly choreographed live-looping sets as a way to recreated my compositions onstage. I was trying to create atmospheric, brooding examinations of memory and compulsion.</p>

    <p>Next I joined experimental Kent-based band Boo, Forever. We produced an eclectic album which was released on vinyl by Something Something Records. I contributed a share of the singing and songwriting, as well as handling production, emphasising the clash between organic acoustic elements and digital production techniques.</p>

    <p>The side project which followed that was Minor Planet, my rap alter ego. I made a playful alternative hip-hop album and collaborated with local filmmaker Joel Snowman to capture a common experience of our home town from the fringes.</p>

    <p>Currently I am reconnecting with the guitar, having let my playing stagnate for many years. I am only allowing myself to play in standard tuning, using hybrid picking, and no effects besides a hint of dirt and some reverb. I expect to return to my open-mic roots with the material that results from this new focused approach.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"The blending of acoustic folk’s soft touch and the cold, processed sound of electronic production is something that has been tried a fair amount but has rarely clicked into place. Kent based Boo, Forever can count themselves amongst the minority that have succeeded. Their self-titled debut draws from the likes of Tuung, Bon Iver et al that have a fellow penchant for mixing the new and the old, resulting in something that is constantly intruiging and whose layers of experimentation are easy to lose one’s self in."</p>
