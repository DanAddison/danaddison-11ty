    <p>I started writing and performing introspective acoustic songs in my first year of art school in Kingston. I joined a local community of musicians staging experimental gigs which combined classical, folk and post-rock styles. Highlights of that period include performing my songs with a full orchestra, and playing Glastonbury Festival in 2008.</p>

    <p>I moved back to Folkestone and focused on music production, recording many solo EPs and albums at home. I recreated my sound onstage by looping vocals, guitar, synth and percussion on the fly. These atmospheric compositions were brooding examinations of memory and compulsion.</p>

    <p>I joined experimental Kent-based band Boo, Forever. We produced an eclectic album which was released on vinyl by Something Something Records. We shared singing and songwriting duties, and I handled production, emphasising the clash between organic acoustic elements and digital production techniques.</p>

    <p>Another notable side project was Minor Planet, my rap alter ego. I made a playful alternative hip-hop album and collaborated with local filmmaker Joel Snowman to capture a common experience of our home town from the fringes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"The blending of acoustic folk’s soft touch and the cold, processed sound of electronic production is something that has been tried a fair amount but has rarely clicked into place. Kent based Boo, Forever can count themselves amongst the minority that have succeeded. Their self-titled debut draws from the likes of Tuung, Bon Iver et al that have a fellow penchant for mixing the new and the old, resulting in something that is constantly intruiging and whose layers of experimentation are easy to lose one’s self in."</p>
